## Brantreat
I developed a mobile application/website that presents daily challenges for users to win rewards. The app seeks to involve brands with users through creative challenges to increase engagement while users have the chance to compete with other users or friends for rewards or promotions of a certain product or service.

Companies benefit from the application user database to attract new clients to their products/services i.e. If thereâ€™s a challenge where users need to take a selfie with a new soda brand and the picture with more likes on facebook or instagram wins a trip to Canada the company will benefit from all the users already using the application to gain visibility on social media while the participants have the chance to be rewarded by the brand.

## Run
First is necessary to add the correct configuration to config/config.json and config/migrations
Then you must run
```bash
npm run migrate
npm start
```
